1. Planned Analysis Workflow To quantify the impact of geopolitical events on Brent oil prices, the following steps will be executed:EDA & Preprocessing: Analyze price trends, stationarity, and volatility clustering.Change Point Modeling: Implement a Bayesian "Switch Point" model using PyMC to identify structural breaks ($\tau$).MCMC Sampling: Use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to generate posterior distributions for the switch point and price parameters ($\mu_1, \mu_2$).Event Correlation: Map detected change points to researched geopolitical events (e.g., OPEC decisions, conflicts).Communication: Develop a Flask API and React dashboard to visualize findings for stakeholders.2. Initial EDA Findings Trend Analysis: The raw price plot indicates a non-linear trend with significant shocks, particularly in 2008 and 2020.Stationarity: An Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test yielded a $p$-value of 0.289. Since $p > 0.05$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of a unit root, confirming the series is non-stationary.Volatility: The Log Returns plot reveals clear "volatility clustering," where large price changes tend to follow large price changes, particularly during global crises.3. Assumptions and Limitations Statistical Correlation vs. Causality: While the model identifies statistical structural breaks that coincide with external events, this proves correlation, not absolute causal impact.Model Scope: The model assumes a single major switch point per analysis window; multiple overlapping events may complicate the results.
