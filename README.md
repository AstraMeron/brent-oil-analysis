# Brent Oil Price Analysis: Geopolitical & Economic Impact

## 📌 Project Overview
This project, conducted for **Birhan Energies**, aims to analyze how major world events—such as geopolitical conflicts, OPEC policy changes, and global economic shocks—affect Brent oil prices. Using daily historical data from 1987 to 2022, we employ **Bayesian Change Point Analysis** to identify structural breaks in the market and quantify the influence of these external factors.

## 🚀 Features
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Trend identification, stationarity testing (ADF), and volatility clustering.
* **Event Correlation:** A curated dataset of 14+ key global events mapped against price fluctuations.
* **Change Point Modeling:** Advanced Bayesian modeling using PyMC to detect shifts in price regimes.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** (Upcoming) A React and Flask-based web application for data visualization.
